          <p className='font-Averta size-28  w-300'> We try invest in companies with the following characteristics:</p>
         
          <ul className="financlial-list font-Averta size-28  w-300 philosophylist">
            <li>Companies based on the fundamentals or the strong businesses trading at deep discount.</li>
            <li>Small companies having significantly high market share in niche sectors with very less competition.</li>
            <li>Companies with cyclical business, currently in the trough or the recovery phase of its business cycle.</li>
            <li>Companies operating at very low capacity where utilisation is at very low levels given its total capacity.</li>
            <li>Companies where strong inflow of orders would be expected in the coming future as explained by the management backed by strong evidence of the demand of the product company is manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Companies where there is significant capex taking place to ramp up the manufacturing / production facilities.</li>
            <li>Companies, despite operating monopolistic market with high product differentiation because these companies can easily raise prices without hindering the demand of their products.</li>
            <li>Companies which spending very less on advertisements.</li>
            <li>Companies where promoter holding is very high where it can be seen that the interests of the promoters are aligned with that of the shareholders.</li>
            <li>Companies in which it is expected to be a radical change in the management where the reins of the business are handed over to the next generation to take it to the new heights.</li>

          factors which we might have looked into at the time of carrying on the research.
