            <li>Companies with cyclical business, currently in the trough or the recovery phase of its business cycle.</li>
            <li>Companies operating at very low capacity where utilisation is at very low levels given its total capacity.</li>
            <li>Companies where strong inflow of orders would be expected in the coming future as explained by the management backed by strong evidence of the demand of the product company is manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Companies where there is significant capex taking place to ramp up the manufacturing / production facilities.</li>
            <li>Companies, despite operating monopolistic market with high product differentiation because these companies can easily raise prices without hindering the demand of their products.</li>
            <li>Companies which spending very less on advertisements.</li>
            <li>Companies where promoter holding is very high where it can be seen that the interests of the promoters are aligned with that of the shareholders.</li>
