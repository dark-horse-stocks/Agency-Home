          At Darkhorsestock, we do not provide any target prices for our suggested companies. However, we are proud to say that most of our past ideas have delivered a minimum of 30-35% returns over 2 years. We also acknowledge that some of our ideas may fail, and we are transparent in stating that we expect around 20-30% of our ideas to not meet expectations. For this reason, we do not suggest that our readers overexpose themselves to any particular company.
