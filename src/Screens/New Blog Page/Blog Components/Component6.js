        In two phases, the business plans to more than triple its capacity to
        over 1000 MT/month by 2023. The extra capacity is created by
        establishing two new greenfield projects.

      <p className="mt-1">
        As part of its phase I development ambitions, the business is
        establishing a 360 MT/month capacity (300 tonnes/month of Synthetic
        Water Soluble Food Colors and 60 tonnes/month of Synthetic Foodgrade
        Lakes) at the Dahej SEZ in Gujarat. The capex is Rs 30 crore, with the
        majority of the funds coming from internal accruals. Civil construction
        has already begun, and commercial production is projected to start
        within this Financial Year.

        Arjun Foods, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vidhi in Roha MIDC, proposes
        to construct 350 tonne/month capacity for producing new high-margin
        goods as part of phase II development plans. The expansion location is
        within 200 metres from the present production site, resulting in
        operational synergies. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has
        provided terms of reference. The estimated time frame is 12-18 months.
        The project expenditure is Rs 30 crore, which would be financed mostly
        through internal accruals. <strong>Expected timeline: FY23</strong>
