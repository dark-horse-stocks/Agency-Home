        The worldwide food colour market is largely driven by rising demand from
        the beverage sector, as well as the bread and confectionery industries.
        The worldwide food colour industry is driven by the growing demand for
        flavoured beverages, fruit juices, and nutritious drinks. Synthetic food
        colours are in high demand for commercial application because to their
        excellent light stability, low cost, and little microbiological
        contamination. Natural food colours, on the other hand, are more
        expensive than synthetic ones.

        In 2018, the global market for food coloring/coloring agents/powders was
        assessed at US$ 2.1 billion. It is expected to reach US$ 3.2 billion by
        2023, with a 9.8 percent CAGR from 2019 to 2023. India's food colour
        exports climbed by 6.5 percent during the last five years, from US$ 203
        million to US$ 263 million. Natural food colours are estimated to be the
        most important product sector, accounting for more than 80% of total
        worldwide market revenue.

        Trade wars occurred all over the world, particularly between China, the
        United States, and Western Europe. Large chemical markets that remain
        accessible in this situation may create chances for Indian chemical
        firms.

      <p className="mt-1">
        The structure of China's chemical industry is changing as a result of
        stricter environmental standards, tighter financing, and consolidation,
        which may present opportunities for India's chemical companies in
        certain value chains and segments, albeit in small proportions given the
        size of the Indian companies.
